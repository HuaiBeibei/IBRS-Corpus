<Title>"(495584) Firefox - search suggestions passes wrong previous result to form history"</Title>
<Annotation>
<AbstractiveSummary>
<Sentence Links = "1.1"> A problem was noticed with the WIP patch from bug 469443 applied.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "1.2">  When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "1.3,1.4">  The problem is nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result, instead of it being the previous form history search result.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "1.6">  The bug wasn't visible before 469443, because nsFormFillController::StartSearch tries QI to provid result to nsIAutoCompleteSimpleResult.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "1.7">  The search-suggestion result is nsIAutoCompletResult now, so QI fails and Satchel is doing a new search everytime.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "2.1,2.2">  A fix was proposed, but wasn't quite right.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "2.4">  Satchel should be smarter about throwing away a previous result when the previous result's search string doesn't have a common prefix.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "3.1,3.3">  Another fix was proposed later, where the service's form history result copy is discarded when startSearch() is called with a null previous result.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "3.2">  There was a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper and also a ._formHistoryResult in SuggestAutoCompleteIt.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "4.2">  It was suggested to rename one of them to _fhResult.</Sentence>
<Sentence Links = "5.5">  The one in the wrapper was renamed to _formHistResult.</Sentence>

<Title>"(238215) Firefox - Add a history window (like in Seamonkey)"</Title>
<Annotation>
<AbstractiveSummary>
<Sentence Links = "1.3,1.4,1.7"> This is an enhancement request for making a separate window for history in Firefox and not relying on sidebar(ctrl-h).</Sentence>

<Sentence Links = "3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8">  A suggestion is made to make an about page for history similar to about:config, which can complement the sidebar and a new separate history window would probably be an overkill.</Sentence>
