bug report ID,sentence,intention
1, MattN noticed a problem with the WIP patch from bug 469443 applied.,0
1," When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider (where entries for previous matching searches are).",0
1, The problem here is that nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousResult to form history.,0
1," Instead of it being the previous form history search result, it's the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result (which contains the union of the form-history and search-suggest entries).",0
1," So, when form history refines its results as you time, it can actually add *more* entries as data leaks from the suggestions result into form history result, and it thus looks like the divider is being drawn in the wrong place.",5
1," This bug wasn't visible before 469443, because nsFormFillController::StartSearch tries to QI the provided result to a nsIAutoCompleteSimpleResult. ",0
1," The search-suggestion result is only implements nsIAutoCompletResult (no \""Simple\""), so the QI fails, historyResult nee previousResult becomes null, and thus Satchel was doing a new search every time.",0
1, EG:,0
1," 1) type \""b\"" in the search field.",0
1," 2) form history finds 1 entry (\""blah\""), search-suggestions finds \""baaa\"", \""bloop\"", \""bzzz\"", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \""blah\"" and \""baaa\"".",0
1," 3) type an \""l\"" in the search field (\""bl\"")",0
1," 4) startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\""blah\"", \""baaa\"", \""bloop\"", \""bzzz\""], Satchel filters this down to [\""blah\"", \""bloop\""] to match the new \""bl\"" search string",0
1," 5) nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.",0
1, Created an attachment (id=380567) [details] Patch v.1 (WIP),6
1," This fixes the problem, but isn't quite correct...",2
1," If you type \""a&lt;backspace&gt;b\"", satchel trying to use the results from the \""a\"" search for the \""b\"" search, and so nothing is found. ",0
1," I suspect nsSearchSuggestions needs to throw away the old form history result when the search string changes like this, but I'm not entirely sure it's responsible for doing so, maybe satchel should be smarter about throwing away a previous result when the previous result's search string doesn't have a common prefix.",2
1," [That seems to be handled somewhere else for normal form field entries, oddly enough.]",2
1, Created an attachment (id=383211) [details] Patch v.2,6
1," Ah. So, there's a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper (used to combine form history with search suggestions), and also a ._formHistoryResult in SuggestAutoComplete (the service itself, used to hold onto a form history result until a search suggestion is available).",0
1, The simple fix it to just discard the service's form history result copy when startSearch() is called with a null previous result.,1
1, Otherwise it's trying to use a old form history result that no longer applies for the search string.,1
1, (From update of attachment 383211 [details]),6
1, Perhaps we should rename one of them to _fhResult just to reduce confusion?,5

1, &gt; Perhaps we should rename one of them to _fhResult just to reduce confusion?,6
1, Good point.,6
1, I renamed the one in the wrapper to _formHistResult. ,1
1, fhResult seemed maybe a bit too short.,2

2, That pref was thought to be for extensions which wanted to completely replace our own Session Restore functionality.,0
2," While this has worked somehow for Tab Mix Plus, we've had several issues with people ending up both Session Restore and Tab Mix Plus disabled (see bug 435055 and its duplicates).",0
2," Furthermore, there are several code points which will also break when Session Restore has been disabled (such as the list of recently closed tabs).",0
2," Instead of adding try-catch-blocks wherever we use Session Restore, I'd much rather encourage extensions authors to override both nsSessionStartup and nsSessionStore to provide the same API with their own functionality (or implementing a dummy-API and making sure for themselves that they've correctly replaced all known consumers).",5
2, This would also make the lives of those other extension authors simpler who so far can't be too sure that the Session Store component actually works (through whatever implementation).,5
2, Note that privacy concerned users will still be able to disable writing to sessionstore.js through the browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash pref.,5
2, Created an attachment (id=332726) [details] ,6
2, remove the pref,6

2," a problem with this patch is that the session data is still stored in memory while the app is running, and by removing this pref, there's no way to disable that.",0
2," some users do not want the recently-closed-tabs menu, and others don't want any session tracks stored in memory at all.",2
2, (In reply to comment #4),6
2," &gt; some users do not want the recently-closed-tabs menu,",4
2, That's what browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo is for: setting it to 0 effectively disables the feature.,1
2, &gt; and others don't want any session tracks stored in memory at all.,4
2," Then again, we don't save any data that wouldn't be in memory, anyway, or do we?",3
2, I'd rather introduce a different pref or different means to cater the privacy sensitive users than have this half-baked cut-it-all pref which AFAICT so far has produced more issues than it's solved.,5

2," &gt; Then again, we don't save any data that wouldn't be in memory, anyway, or do we?",4
2, Fair point. I'm not sure.,6
2, &gt; I'd rather introduce a different pref or different means to cater the privacy sensitive users than have this half-baked cut-it-all pref which AFAICT so far has produced more issues than it's solved.,4

2, Pushed as 17120:e712e96d7861 and 17121:adb1ef78dd21.,4
2, onemen: This patch significantly affects Tab Mix Plus:,4
2," Instead of disabling SessionStore, you'll now have to replace it by shipping a component which implements the same API.",5
2," You should be able to keep that component minimal, though, and just call your own code whenever the API is used.",5
2," This will make the lives of people using the SessionStore API (such as Session Manager) somewhat simpler, as they can just use the API without having to worry too much about the implementation behind it.",2
2," If you want to offer the option of switching between your and our implementation, see e.g. the ignore-history component of the Torbutton extension for how to overwrite a component with the original still being available internally (so that you can either pass API calls forward or handle them yourself).",5
2, Sounds like this has impact for extension authors and so should be documented on MDC,5
2, no problem.,6
2, current Tabmix dev-build already not disable SessionStore,2
2," I currently have only one problem , how to disable the restore after restart.",3
2," can you add a pref for this, or some other way to do it?",3
2, (In reply to comment #12),4
2," &gt; I currently have only one problem , how to disable the restore after restart.",4
2, You've got several options for that:,6
2, * Set the prefs browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash and browser.sessionstore.resume_session_once both to false as early as possible and make sure that browser.startup.page isn't 3.,1
2, * Delete the file sessionstore.js as early as possible (e.g. when the profile-after-change notification is dispatched).,1
2, * For Firefox 3.1: Respond to the sessionstore-state-read notification by setting the subject's data member to an empty string (cf. bug 448741 comment#6).,1
2, Or is there a use case I'm missing?,3
3," I've noticed that I frequently trigger the rotate gesture accidentally, usually while scrolling.",0
3," Gestures have improved since the original landing (when triggering the wrong gesture was really easy), but this articular gesture is still problematic.",0
3, The basic reasoning is that it's highly disruptive to be switched to another tab when you're not expecting it.,0
3," When it happens, you don't know what just happened until you notice that you're on some entirely different page, that's randomly to the left or right (1 or more tabs) from the page you thought you were on.",0
3," I'm don't think the rotate gesture for switching tabs is nearly as useful, discoverable, or a good fit as the other gestures are.",2
3," So, given this problem, we should just disable it for 3.5. ",5
3," [I'd also be open to tweaking it to make it much harder to trigger accidentally, dunno if that's possible.]",5
3, See also bug 461376. ,6
3, Just play around with browser.gesture.twist.* in about:config as a temporary workaround.,5
3," Justin, the odd thing here is that I find I trigger zoom more frequently than tab rotate ... far far more frequently.",0
3," And I also find that it's not just in Firefox, it's all over OSX.",0
3, I wonder how much of this is us vs. odd timings causing misreads of the trackpad by OSX.,2
3, I think I've never accidentally switched tab because of rotate gesture.,2
3, Actually I'd probably decrease the default threshold for tab switching.,5
3, I've triggered zoom repeatedly too; ,2
3, usually I fix it right away but a quick browse though content-prefs.sqlite shows ~20 sites with zoom settings that I didn't know were set.,5
3," That's probably because zoom is a subtle effect (for 1 step, relative to the distraction that an accidental tab switch causes).",5
3," While playing with different browser.gesture.twist settings, I've found twisting through tabs often resulted in triggering a zoom. ",0
3," Probably because a twist is a very awkward gesture to make, especially if it's more than a quarter-turn... ",5
3," Around that point, my fingers want to spread or join, and that ends up read as a pinch. ",0
3," I guess that's part of why I'm not really fond of this gesture, and would just as soon turn it off.",5
3," I'll try running with a threshold of 40, but I suspect there's an unavoidable conflict between making it easy to use on purpose, yet hard to invoke accidentally.",5
3," I've been using swipe left/right to change tabs and cmd-left/right to go back/forward, but I do have rotate as change tabs as well and I haven't accidentally triggered it.",2
3, Maybe it's your rotating technique ;) ,2
3, I'm right handed and I position my index finger at 7oclock and ring finger at 1oclock. ,5
3, To rotate right I end up at 8/2oclocks.,5
3, The first time I came into contact with tab switching via gesture was accidentally. ,2
3," I wasn't sure what happened, I just appeared on another tab and couldn't figure out why. ",2
3, The tab-switching gesture right now isn't obvious and feels unexpected when I hit it.,2
3," Mardak: the way you've written this code, disabling the gesture is a pref-flip, right?",3
3," Blocking here for decision and mulling, will probably take it though.",2
3," Yup, should be able to just unset the default value for the twist prefs:",5
3," -pref(\""browser.gesture.twist.right\"", \""Browser:NextTab\"");",4
3," -pref(\""browser.gesture.twist.left\"", \""Browser:PrevTab\"");",4
3," Would setting the value to empty-string (\""\"") work, or something similar? ",3
3, It would be nice to leave the prefs visible for those who want to use them.,5
3, Since this is now implemented on Win7 with Multitouch screens please be sure not to disable it for Windows.,5
3, (In reply to comment #10),4
3, &gt; Since this is now implemented on Win7 with Multitouch screens please be sure not to disable it for Windows.,4
3, Fine by me; though I'd be a bit wary of having Windows users hit the same problem with multitouch trackpads...,2
3," But Rob says such hardware/drivers doesn't exist today, so it shouldn't be a common problem.",2
3," We should keep on eye out for problems with issues on touchscreens, andt from Rob demoing it on his touchscreen it would appear harder to trigger. ",5
3, And maybe Windows 7 is just better at discriminating between gestures.,5
3, OTOH it wouldn't be a big deal to just disable it globally. ,5
3," Safari doesn't use it, and Rob confirmed that IE doesn't use it on Windows 7.",2
3," This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too?",3
3," If we take those out, we'll have swipe up/down as jump to top/bottom and swipe left/right as back/forward by default.",5
3, (In reply to comment #12),4
3," &gt; This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too?",4
3, Maybe; it certainly has been noted that people are accidentally hitting that gesture too. ,2
3," Though I think it's a separate decision: rotate is an unnatural gesture for switching tabs (nothing else uses it this way), with a high penalty for accidentally triggering. ",2
3," Pinching is a natural gesture for page zoom (and more widely used/known), with a low penalty for accidentally triggering. ",0
3," I think most people would consider it a bug if we claimed to support multitouch, but pinch didn't do anything.",2
3," So, I'd strongly lean towards only removing the rotate. Pinchy would've wanted it this way.",5
3, (In reply to comment #12),4
3," &gt; This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too?",4
3, &gt; ,4
3," &gt; If we take those out, we'll have swipe up/down as jump to top/bottom and swipe left/right as back/forward by default.",4
3, pinch should definitely be left on for win7.,5
3, Tracking is turned off so you get a nice zoom in/zoom out effect. ,5
3, It's also nearly impossible to trigger without a definitive pinch with two fingers on the screen.,2
3," If you want to consider disabling pinch, please file a separate bug, do not conflate. ",5
3," FWIW, I'm not nearly as keen on disabling that one, and am fairly-to-surely likely to WONTFIX such a bug.",2
3, But go ahead ... try me ;) ,6
3, Created an attachment (id=376850) [details],4
3, v1,4
3, Don't do anything on os x when twisting.,5
3," Alternatively, have people tried upping the threshold for twist? ",5
3, It would make it less likely to accidentally trigger.,5
3, But I just noticed something interesting in os x's gesture detection.,2
3," - If I use 2 hands (1 finger each) and place one at the top and one at the bottom, moving the top finger registers as a normal mouse move while moving the bottom finger is registered as a twist.",0
3, I suppose the heuristic there is to assume the top finger is used for scrolling.,0
3," - Also, if your fingers are too close to the edge, it won't treat it as a rotate. But you can still move the pointer from the edge.",0
3, Can we get the patch reviewed - I think we want to remove the rotate gesture on both Windows and OSX.,5

4, Problem:,6
4," The method FolderDescription#createExistentResourceFromHandle(IResource,IProgressMonitor) checks if the folder already exists and returns immediately if so.",0
4," In cases where the FolderDescription has members which are not existing at that moment, that members will not be created.",0
4, Use case:,6
4, Assume you want to create a folder and a file in that folder and use two operations for this. ,5
4, I know it is not necessary to use two operations but my configuration is more complex than this example code.,2
4, IFolder folder = ... // must not exist,4
4," CreateFolderOperation op1 = new CreateFolderOperation(folder,...);",4
4, IFile file = folder.getFile(...); // must not exist,4
4," CreateFileOperation op1 = new CreateFileOperation(file,...);",4
4, op1.execute(...);,4
4, op2.execute(...);,4
4, The execution of the op2 does not create the file because as stated above createExistentResourceFromHandle returns immediately because the parent folder of the file was created by op1.,0
4, IMHO createExistentResourceFromHandle must check if members of a FolderDescription should be created.,5
4, I checked the code in the ganymede release and the problem should exist there too.,3
4, Is there any reason you cannot execute op1 before creating op2?,3
4," The basic problem is that the workspace file structure has changed since you first created the operation, so the change described by the operation is no longer valid.",0
4, &gt;Is there any reason you cannot execute op1 before creating op2?,4
4, No there is not.,6
4, In the meantime I found a workaround in my code but I think it's very inconvenient that someone must know that op2 have to be created after the execution of op1. ,1
4, The API gave me no hint that I have to do so!,6
4, Maybe the build of the FolderDescription could be delayed until the execution of op2.,5
4, Think about cases where the to ops have nothing in common e.g. created and executed in different plug-ins.,5
4, I'll mark this one for M4.,6
4," I think what needs to happen is that the javadoc better describes the lifecycle of these operations, and the isValid() method is tightened up so that the operation becomes invalid when the workspace changes to no longer match its recorded state.  ",5
4," It is not the intention of these classes to stay in synch with workspace changes that happen independently of a shared, sequential workspace history.",1
4, Moving target as M6 has shipped.,4
4, Fixed in HEAD &gt;20090416.,4
4," In order to understand better what the ramifications might be of actually fixing this bug vs. better documenting the limitations and usage, I started by implementing a trial fix for the problem as reported.",1
4, It is pretty straightforward to rearrange the code to create the child resources (the file) even if the parent exists since the operation was created.,1
4," However, the problems occur later when you try to undo such an operation. ",0
4," Since the operation \""remembered\"" that the folder didn't exist when it was first created, the undo of the create file operation tries to also delete the folder.  ",1
4," This means that to truly fix the bug, we'd have to change the operations so that the resource descriptions were constantly updated to deal with changes that occurred.",1
4, So I still believe it's better to document more clearly what the intentions of the API are.  ,1
4," I've updated the javadoc for AbstractResourcesOperation, CreateFileOperation, and CreateFolderOperation.  ",1
4," In addition, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree already exist.  ",1
4, Created WorkspaceOperationsTest.test250125() to simulate this condition.  ,1
4," The CreateFileOperation is valid until the CreateFolderOperation is run, at which time the file operation knows it is invalid.",1
4," &gt; In addition, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree already exist. ",4
4, What I meant to say is...,6
4, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree *that did not exist when the operation was created* already exist at the time of execution.  ,1
4," It is expected/allowed that the containment tree already exists when the op is executed, as long they also existed when the op was created.",1
4, verified via automated test cases that run on each build.,1
4, Also verified through source inspection,1
5," Inspired by Martin Oberhuber's mail about his \""lsc\"" script for counting lines in a patch[1], I though that it maybe be worthwhile to embed such thing in the Apply Patch wizard itself. ",5
5," imo using regexp should be enough here, especially due to the fact that we don't want to make any additional dependencies. ",5
5," So, my proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a \""real contribution\"".",5
5, This is what first came to my head:,6
5, /-\\\\+? (\\s*\\S+\\s*)+$,4
5," which means \""Count only lines starting with single '+' and a space. ",5
5," The line must also have at least one non-whitespace character\"". ",5
5, I think this is more/less what Martin's script does.,2
5, All lines that match the above pattern would be sum up and the info would be displayed somewhere on the Apply Patch wizard. ,1
5, How does it sound? Martin?,3
5," Again, I think it's a brilliant idea Martin.",6
5, [1] sent to eclipse.org-committers,4
5, The info could be also shown in a patch outline view (see bug 190418).,4
5, Excellent idea! ,6
5, Having the line counter right in the apply patch wizard would finally give us a standard way of counting lines that everybody could use easily.,5
5," My script also ignores \""empty comment\"" lines of the form",5
5,    /-\\\\+\\s+[#*]+\\s+$,4
5, but that's really neglectible and I'm fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch.,5
5," Actually, couldn't your regex even be simpler, say",5
5,    /-\\\\+\\s+\\S,4
5, since you don't need to check till the end of the line?,3
5," And actually, if the wizard counts added lines, why shouldn't it also count removed lines? ",5
5, Giving two separate numbers e.g.,5
5,    10 lines added  20 lines removed,4
5, This sounds familiar to me since I've seen similar numbers in RCS files before.,5
5," I'd guess that the regex for removed lines could just be the same as for added lines but the + replaced by a -; and, files removed entirely should contribute the entire number of lines they had before (I believe that the old contents is",5

8, Here is the JavaDoc for IAdapterManager.computeClassOrder(Class):,4
8, Returns the class search order for a given class. ,0
8," The search order from a class with the definition class X extends Y implements A, B is as follows:",0
8, - the target's class: X ,4
8, - X's superclasses in order to Object ,4
8," - a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces (in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces) ",4
8, This comment is not perfectly clear. ,6
8," In particular, it does not complete the example by explicitly listing the exact order the example classes and interfaces are returned.",0
8, I came up with a slightly richer example:,2
8,"     interface A extends M, N",4
8,     interface B extends O,4
8,"     class Y implements C, D",4
8,"     class X extends Y implements A, B",4
8," [The declarations for interfaces C, D, M, N, and O are trivial.] ",4
8, The order of classes and interfaces returned by AdapterManager.computeClassOrder(X) is:,4
8,     class X,4
8,     interface A,4
8,     interface B,4
8,     interface M,4
8,     interface N,4
8,     interface O,4
8,     class Y,4
8,     interface C,4
8,     interface D,4
8,     class java.lang.Object,4
8," This conflicts with the JavaDoc. The class X is the first thing returned, but it is *not* followed by \""X's superclasses in order to Object\"". ",0
8," It is followed by a breadth-first list of X's interface hierarchy\"", *then* followed by X's superclass Y, which is then followed by a breadth-first list of Y's interface hierarchy; and so on, up to  java.lang.Object.",0
8," Also, the JavaDoc has what reads to me as a contradiction:",0
8,     a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces,0
8, vs. ,4
8,"     in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces",0
8," What actually happens *does* feel like a \""breadth-first\"" search; ",0
8," but that would not be accurately described as \""A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\"". ",0
8, But maybe I'm reading it wrong....,2
8," It might be worth discussing which is the \""preferred\"" behavior: the behavior described by the JavaDoc or the behavior implemented in AdapterManager. ",5
8," In some ways having all the classes first, followed by the interfaces might make more sense than the current implementation.... ",5
8," But, then you have the whole \""backward-compatibility\"" thing to worry about....",5
8, You are right on both counts. ,2
8," The implementation doesn't match the spec, and there is a contradiction in the spec itself. ",0
8, Now the question is what do we do about it.,0
8,"  - For the contradiction, I think we should stick with the breadth-first search, and delete the parenthetic comment about the example (\""A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\"")",5
8,"  - For the spec not matching the behaviour, my instinct is to \""fix\"" the spec to match the implementation, to avoid the risk of breaking clients. ",5
8, This would be a very subtle change that could affect clients in unpredictable ways. ,0
8," On the other hand if there are really compelling reasons to change the implementation to match the spec, I'd be curious to hear them.",5
8," I did some research and found that the implementation did match the spec until Febuary 20, 2004, when I change the implementation. ",0
8, At that time the spec wasn't part of the API. ,0
8, The spec was later added to the API (IAdapterManager#computeClassOrder) without checking that the implementation still matched. ,5
8, I'm going to do some more archeology to see if I can figure out why I changed the lookup order.,5
8, It would be interesting to know what triggered the change in behavior.,2
8," I guess the question is whether superclasses take precedence over interfaces defined lower in the hierarchy, i.e. does the implementation take precedence over the specification? ",2
8, I can see arguments for either way; but I guess I would probably come down on the side of giving specification precedence. ,2
8," So, I guess you argue further that all the interfaces could precede all the classes?",2
8, Argh...why did I even ask? :-),3
8," Anyway, I don't have any use cases at the moment to argue one way or the other.",0
8," It's just that my curiosity got the better of me, after years of wondering, \""Just how does the Platform resolve which adapter to return?\"" :-)",0
8, It looks like this change was made inadvertently during a large batch of changes to add support for the adapters extension point (bug 32498). ,0
8," I think since this change was introduced accidentally, and this is a clear violation of a long-standing specification, I'm leaning towards fixing the implementation. ",2
8, I noticed the spec also doesn't mention the interfaces of the target class' superclasses. ,0
8, I think the corrected spec should read:,5
8,          * &lt;ul&gt;,4
8,          * &lt;li&gt;the target's class: X,4
8,          * &lt;li&gt;X's superclasses in order to &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;,4
8,"          * &lt;li&gt;a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by &lt;code&gt;getInterfaces&lt;/code&gt; (in the example, X and its superinterfaces then Y and its superinterfaces) &lt;/li&gt;",4
8,          * &lt;/ul&gt;,4
8," Note that the comment changed to \""X and its superinterfaces then Y...\"" as opposed to \""A and its superinterfaces then B...\"". ",1
8," Thus this clarifies how the interfaces of superclasses are considered, while fixing the contradiction in the specification of interface search order.",1

11, When images are rescaled now the GIMP always defaults to linear scaling.,0
11, Sometimes I want to do a bunch of images with cubic scaling. ,0
11, It would be handy that the scale dialog just remembered the last setting and always present that one.,0
11, The default interpolation routine can be choosen in the Preferences dialog.,5
11," I just thought it would be easier if it just remembered the last setting, that way a newbie does not have to search trough the preferences, and it is handy if you want to scale a set of images in a different way as normally",5
11, Jaap is right. ,6
11, I didn't know about the preferences setting until I saw this bug report.,2
11," This applies in general to options that the user can set without going into the preferences dialog: just remember the last setting, and there is no need for an entry in the preferences dialog.",5
11," We would need an entry whether to save the last used setting, for the users who don't want this.",5
11," Michael, I don't agree with having an extra entry whether to save the setting yes or no. ",2
11, This would clutter the interface even more. ,2
11, Because you then still need an entry in preferences and you need an extra entry in the scale dialog whether to save the last used setting. ,2
11, Just always remembering the last setting is conceptually by far the easiest for new users. ,5
11, Furthermore I think it's not really a problem if you have to change the setting now and then (In your case you also have to click once more to not save the setting). ,5
11, And most of the times you will not change this setting.,5
11," I agree that it is convenient to be able to set a default value from the place it is used (e.g., the Image-&gt;Scale dialog) instead of having to open the Preferences and find the corresponding option.",3
11, This is very useful for those who are not familiar with all options available in the Preferences.,2
11," However, I disagree with the proposal that the last setting should automatically become the default: I have set the default to Cubic (I might change it to Lanczos soon) and I expect it to be used all the time. ",2
11," But from time to time, I scale up a bitmap image without interpolation.",2
11, I don't want this to become the new default and give me bad results when I scale up another image two days later.,2

15, gvfs-ftp-read-directory.patch,4
15, Proposed patch. ,6
15, Introducing new system of handling error 550 messages based on Benjamin's idea. ,1
15, So far only simple check if the target is directory has been implemented.,1
15," Please review the patch, I especially don't like keeping references to GVfsBackendFtp and processed file in the FtpConnection object but it is the easiest way to do it.",5
15," The patch gets the gist of what I want, but it looks ugly in places. ",5
15, Here's what I think on how to solve those:,2
15," My idea was that the error handlers should be implemented with simple ftp_connection_send() commands, that set errors automatically. ",5
15, So the is_directory handler would look something like this:,5
15, static void,4
15," error_550_is_directory (FtpConnection *conn, const FtpFile *file)",4
15, {,4
15,"   guint response = ftp_connection_send (conn,  RESPONSE_PASS_500, \""cwd %s\"", file);",4
15,   if (response == 550),4
15,     {,4
15,"       g_set_error (&conn-&gt;error, G_IO_ERROR,  G_IO_ERROR_IS_DIRECTORY, _(\""File is a directory\""));",4
15,     },4
15,   else if (STATUS_GROUP (response) == 5),4
15,     {,4
15,"       ftp_connection_set_error_from_response (conn, response);",4
15,     },4
15, },4
15, So we'd have a bunch of error handlers named error_550_$ERROR_WE_CHECK() like error_550_not_found or  error_550_permission_denied that do some ftp sending magic to figure out specific things.,5
15," While writing the above code, it occured to me that we might want to have a new flag \""RESPONSE_PASS_550\"" just for the 550 error code, which would help in quite some cases and make the above function look like this:",5
15, static void,4
15," error_550_check_directory (FtpConnection *conn, const FtpFile *file)",4
15, {,4
15,"   guint response = ftp_connection_send (conn,  RESPONSE_PASS_550, \""cwd %s\"", file);",4
15,   if (response == 550),4
15,     {,4
15,"       g_set_error (&conn-&gt;error, G_IO_ERROR,  G_IO_ERROR_IS_DIRECTORY, _(\""File is a directory\""));",4
15,     },4
15, },4
15," I also think that we want a seperate ftp_connection_send_and_check function, that does the job of doing special 550 checks, as there's a lot of cases where those aren't needed. ",2
15, The code would roughly look like this:,5
15," typedef void (* Ftp550Handler) (FtpConnection *conn, const FtpFile *file);",4
15, static void,4
15," ftp_connection_check_file (FtpConnection *conn,  const Ftp550Handler *handlers, const FtpFile *file)",4

15,       response = 0;,4
15,     },4

15, },4
15," This also solves the problem of having our 550 handling move into the response codes, which looks a bit unfortunate API wise.",1
15," And we get rid of adding more members to the FtpConnection struct, especially those that don't belong there.",5
15, Some smaller things:,6
15," - The function was called \""error_550_check_directory\"". ",5
15," That's a somewhat bad choice for a name, as I don't know if it checks whether the file is or is not a directory.",5
15, - Please change the default error code for 550 to G_IO_ERROR_FAILED. ,5
15," \""Operation failed\"" sounds much better than \""File unavailable\"". ",5
15," And it tells us where we miss 550 checks: Whenever we get \""FAILED\"" :)",5
15," - Your patch includes the \""LIST -a\"" change for bad directory listings.",5

16," When considering accessor functions, you might also want to consider raising the API up to a bit higher level.  ",5
16," For example, the Combo widget should probably have its own value-changed signal and direct access to the underlying entry and list widgets should be deprecated with some higher level functions written for the Combo widget to get at necessary functionality.  ",5
16," Since the GtkList widget is already deprecated, this stuff is going to break in applications someday anyway.",5
16," No kidding about the breakability in the combo box: this is already pretty much broken in GTK-- (C++ binding), where they use a different implementation for the (deprecated) list, which basically makes it impossible to access list data. ",5
16, A change in the GTK+ API to allow access to the list items through a function would make this a whole lot more usable.,5

17," + * version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.",4
17," There is no \""Lesser GPL version 2\"". ",1
17, It's the Lesser GPL version 2.1 (or the Library GPL version 2).,1
17, Somehow I feel that gtk_show_help() is too GNOME oriented to be included in this form. ,2
17, I have been told that gtk_show_uri() will work nicely on the major supported platforms.,2
17, This is hwoever not the case for gtk_show_help(). ,0
17," Since the functionality of gtk_show_help() can be easily implemented on top of gtk_show_uri(), it should be sufficient to provide gtk_show_uri() for now.",5

17," Christian, I copied the license from other files in GTK+.",1
17, I opened about 5 to 6 files and they are the same. ,0
17, I guess it's a better idea to change all licenses in one go,2
17, What's the consensus on this?,3
17, Can I commit gtkshow.c to gtk+ when I remove gtk_show_help?,3
17, Update your patch to remove gtk_show_help() to start with.,5
17, Created an attachment (id=106302) [details],4
17, Patch removing gtk_show_help,1
17, Can one of the maintainers decided what to do with this patch? Thanks,3
17," gtk_show_uri allows a NULL parent, but that is not multi-head safe.",1
17, Why not take a mandatory GdkScreen argument since the function couldn't care less about the parent widget beyond its screen?,5
17, I can make it such that the parent has to be set mandatory.,1
17, Having a GtkWidget *parent saves calling a gtk_widget_get_screen everytime you do a gtk_show_uri,1
17, What's the opinion on this of others?,3
17," I don't think the parent should be mandatory, because there are situations",2
17, where they may not be a parent at all.,2
17," A mandatory parent would be bad, as Ross explained in comment #11. ",2
17, IMO the best solution is to change the function to take a GdkScreen instead of a parent widget. ,5
17, Shouldn't hurt much to call gtk_widget_get_screen().,5
17, Created an attachment (id=107888) [details],4
17, Updated gtk_show_uri patch now using a GdkScreen as input,1
17, Thanks for you comments. ,6
17, Any more comments?,3
17, Ping. Can above patch be applied?,3
17, Can one of the maintainers make a decision about this patch.,3
17, Thanks,6
17, Some comments: ,6
17," - Wrt to the parent issue, I think the function should accept NULL there. ",5
17,"   Being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen() is annoyance, when  GdkAppLaunchContext handles unset screen already.",5
17, - The documentation needs to go in some more detail about what kind of 'uri' this function accepts. ,5
17," There is no standard for this, unfortunately, and the gnome-vfs-&gt;gio transition has unearthed a number of problems due to this.",5
17, - I'd be interested in a function that mounts the volume before opening it.,5
17, This is what e.g. the panel needs (see bug 529243 ). ,5
17," That could be a separate function, or gtk_uri_show could take flags.",5
17, Created an attachment (id=109974) [details],4
17, Updated patch. GdkScreen can be NULL,1
17," Matthias, thanks for the review. ",6
17, I've updated the patch with your first two comments.,1
17, About the third comment (the auto mounting). ,6
17, Why would gtk_show_uri need extra flags for this? ,3
17, We could add code that just tries to mount if this is necessary. ,5
17, Your patch in bug 529243 uses libgnomeui/gnome-password-dialog.h which can't be used in gtk+,2
17, What do you want to do? ,3
17, Commit this patch (quite some apps could reduce their dependency on libgnomeui and friends already) and later on add the mounting part,5
17, Matthias: being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen is a good thing as it avoids multiscreen bugs.  ,5
17," If GdkAppLaunchContext handles it, as you say, that sounds like that ought to be fixed too.  ",2
17, There really is no way the gdk/gtk layer can know what screen should be used.,2
17," OK, this bug report has gotten silly.&lt;/monty-python&gt;",2
17," In 99% of use cases, the user interacts with some widget, and as a result, the program wants to show a URI on the same screen as that widget.",5
17," In 99% of the remaining 1% of use cases, the program has no opinion at all about what screen to show the URI on (eg, gnome-open), and so it's going to pass NULL for parent regardless of whether parent is a GtkWidget or a GtkScreen. ",5
17," (Or in the mandatory GtkScreen case, it would always call gdk_screen_get_default().)",2
17," Given that this is a 10-line function, it seems silly to make its interface less convenient for 99% of users just so it can cover an additional 0.01% of use cases. ",5
17," Assuming there actually are programs that need to show URIs on specific screens that do not correspond to any live widget, the developers of those programs can just cut and paste the gtk_show_uri source and change it accordingly.",2
17, accordingly.,6
17, Jaap: the way to handle mounting in GTK+ is to use a GtkMountOperation. ,1
17," I'm not 100% happy with the single-function header gtkshow.h, but I don't really have a better alternative.",2
17," It is probably ok to commit it in this form now, we'll figure out the mounting later.",2
17, Thanks for the review. It's now committed,5

23," 1) Although the underlying cause may be the same, the symptoms of the two bugs are very different.",2

24, Possibly there's a difference here between shift and command-clicking (on a Mac). ,5
24, Shift click should perhaps select everything between the clicked folder and the currently selected folder. ,5

25," Thanks, your hotfix fixed this problem, however on the past KrushDay someone mentioned a similar issue pressing Alt+PrintScr which is still present for me.",1
25," I don't know if this is related with the original issue, but if not you can close this bug.",2
25," It could be, I'll check later today. ",2
25, IIRC Alt+Print Screen is some snapshot function right? ,3
25, You can easily check wether its the same issue by doing the following:,5
25, Open $HOME/.kde4/share/config/kglobalshortcutsrc and find the action there.,5
25, Then open any shortcut dialog in any application and change one of the shortcuts. ,5
25, When you're asked for pressing the new keyboard combination press the Alt+Print keys and check wether the label of the shortcut button is now the same as that in the rc-file. ,5
25," If they differ its the same problem and that means we need a different fix for this problem, than the hotfix I comitted.",5
25," In kglobalshortcutsrc I have assigned Alt+Print to kwin, and also Alt+Shift+Tab to kwin. ",5
25," But if in one application like Konqueror or Konsole I assing a new shortcurt to Alt+Print it get's changed automatically to Alt+Shift+Print, so I can't assign another Alt+Print shortcut.",5
25," However I can assign Alt+Shift+Tab shortcut, but besides it is still showing it in shortcut settings it doesn't work, and also it doesn't appear in kglobalshortcutsrc apart from the old one already existing and assigned to kwin.",2
25," Also I don't know if is my setup but in 'kcmshell4 keys' I can't modify any shortcut, in fact, it doesn't show any, but that can be another bug.",2
25," Ok  as far as I can see this is the same problem, namely that the keys Alt+Print don't produce the X11 keysequence that is expected. ",0
25, In particular Alt+Shift+Tab creates a Qt key sequence of Alt+Shift+Backtab and seemingly Alt+Print creates Alt+Shift+Print in Qt key sequence. ,5
25, So this is indeed the same problem.,5
25," Regarding the keys kcm: Thats \""expected\"", the kcm hasn't been properly ported.",0
25, I've already posted a patch for a minimal port to the kde-core list. ,5
25," That one will get comitted next monday, unless I get objections.",5

29,  This is more of a 'wishlist' since Kate doesn't really have this (see below).  ,5

29, If you want hello2 to move left go to Tools and hit 'Unindent' which will move it left to the tab stop. ,5
29," If you 'Indent' it will move to position 16, the next tab stop to the right.",5

29, Currently it works only if you use the 'cstyle' auto-indenter.  ,5

29," How does this work with things inside parenthesis, like parameter lists and conditionals?",3
29, I'd like to have it as in emacs:,2

29,    doit();,4
29, },4
29," In this case the second condition should be aligned with the first one, not according to normal stuff.",5

29," Yes, your first example works as expected.",2
29, Your second example kinda works right now.  ,2

29," With regards to the foo-bar problem, this was intentional. ",5
29, I didn't want to indent empty lines as that would leave quite a bit of useless leading spaces when selecting large regions and hitting Align -- it's also MUCH slower if I do not skip these lines when formatting an entire document. ,5

30," It would be usefull to add a \""Swap\"" button to quickly change the aspect ratio between portrait and landscape. ",5

30," Since there is no sign that this is going to happen for 2.4, I am bumping the target to Future.",5
30, *** Bug 355694 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***,4
30, I'm going to reset this to 2.4 because I expect to implement this very soon.,5
30, An easier and much faster user interface: swap between portrait and landscape based on mouse movement.,5
30, You already have to move the mouse to make your selection. ,5
30, You'll likely do something that is approximately the right ratio. ,5
30," If that's closer to portrait, then portrait should get used, otherwise landscape should get used.",5
30, Another way to explain this:,5
30," When the user makes the selection, select landscape mode if the horizontal mouse movement is greater than the vertical mouse movement, otherwise select portrait mode.",5
30, That's one less confusing button occupying screen space.,5
30, That's one less button to press. ,5
30," You can work faster, with less hand/finger/wrist pain.",5
30," Albert, you completely misunderstood this. ",2
30, The point is being able to flip the aspect ratio after you have created your rectangle selection.,2
30, Really? I found Alberts comment spot on. ,2
30," It basically would eliminate the need for this kind of button, since both x and 1/x would work equivalently in the GUI.",5
30, I don't see much point in being able to flip the aspect *after* the creation of the rectangle. ,2
30, The placement of the resulting rectangle would need readjusting anyways (what is the fixed point of the rectangle while flipping?) and it sounds much more natural to me to be able to switch the orientation on-the-fly while creating the rectangle.,2
30, I'm the reporter of the wish. ,2
30," Sven is right, I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection. ",2

30,  3. I shrink the rectangle to permit him to be rotated by 90Â°,5
30,"  4. I \""rotate\"" him by taking my calculator, and calculating 1/[aspect ratio], and putting it by hand",5
30,  5. I've now a perfect portrait zone wich I can adapt freely to my flower; and I'm happy :),5
30,"  I don't know if adding a toolButton just to do it is a problem, but I really think I'm not the only one to do that sort of cropping on a photo.",2
30, Thanks for interest !,6
30, Bruno,6
30, I agree that Albert's idea makes sense.  ,2
30, Have gimp assume a landscape or portrait orientation automatically depending on whether the rectangular area swept out by the user is wider or higher.  ,5
30," This might only be problematic when the aspect ratio was nearly, but not exactly square, but even here the user could control the proper aspect by exaggerating the motion in the larger of the two directions.",5
30," If a swap button is maintained as in 2.3.12, then register the initial point used to sweep out the rectangular area and use that as the anchor rather than the upper-left corner as is now used.  ",5
30, It is very likely that the first point selected by the user will be a desired point and this will not be the upper-left corner unless this happens to be where they started.,5
30," As I stated elsewhere, it would also be great if the aspect ratio was automatically set to the initial aspect of the image being loaded.  ",5
30," You might provide a \""lock\"" button to force the current aspect ratio to be retained upon subsequent loading of images for those times when someone wants to crop a series of pictures to the same proportions.  ",5
30," Maybe the current Fix button could be a toggle that switched between \""Lock\"" (lock the aspect ratio - current behavior) \""Set\"" (automatically set the aspect ratio for each new image and then locks it) \""Auto\""(the Set behavior combined with the behavior suggested by Albert) or \""None\"".",5
30," Having said this, I do appreciate having a toggle button at all.  Thanks.",5
30, Making this depend on the user's mouse action is not discoverable. ,5
30, There wouldn't be any way for the user to find out how to swap the aspect ratio. ,5
30, No way.,6
30, It might make sense to determine the initial aspect ratio this way. ,5
30, But there still needs to be a button to swap it. ,5
30, Comment #7 is exactly the usage scenario for this.,5
30, This is now implemented in trunk and seems to work reasonably well. ,1

34, The first revision where it happens is 760614:,5
34, http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=760614,4
34, i'm running trunk. ,0
34, i can ctrl+c svn for example or a compile job. ,0
34, but i can't ctrl+c dselect (or btdownloadcurses or ...),0
34," after i switch to konsole window, cursor doesn't filled and ctrl+c doesn't works, but if i type something then this passes to konsole _and_ cursor became fillled after that i'm able to use ctrl+c",0
34," ie, switch to konsole",0
34, press &lt;space&gt; (to get cursor filled),0
34, press ctrl+c (will work now),0
34," this doesn't always work, cursor became filled, but ctrl+c doesn't work",0
34, ctrl+c works in bash or read prompt (even with non-filled cursor),0
34," Robert, I can confirm what Paolo said: it happens first in 760614 revision (porting to KProcess).",3
34, I also noticed this warning in Session.cpp's Session::sendSignal() function:,5
34," #warning \""TODO: Send the right signal here, QProcess::kill() always sends SIGKILL\""",5
34," I blindly tried to replace _shellProcess-&gt;kill() with _shellProcess-&gt;terminate(), but that did not help, so I gave up :)",5
34, Maybe this even not that piece of code that causes the problem (although seems quite related).,5
34, Maybe you'll have some further ideas.,5
34," And I wasn't able to reproduce this bug on my machine at work, although both home and work machines run Debian/testing (but have different hardware).",0
34, I'm puzzled what can cause this :),0
34," But while it's reproducable here, at home, I can test your ideas if any.",0
34, &gt; I also noticed this warning in Session.cpp's Session::sendSignal() function: ,5
34, That is only called at the end of the terminal session to kill the main shell process.  ,5
34, Otherwise Konsole doesn't touch any processes directly - it just sends the key presses you enter to the terminal.,2
34, &gt; although both home and work machines run Debian/testing,5
34," In other words, they have the same versions of all common software?",3
34, &gt; (but have different hardware),5
34, Do they use the same type of CPU?  ,5
34, I don't suppose it could be a 32bit / 64bit difference?,3
34," Ah, no, seems unrelated :)",2
34, How about this:,5
34, void Pty::lockPty(bool lock),4
34, {,4
34," #warning \""TODO: Support for locking the Pty\""",4
34,   //if (lock),4
34,     //suspend();,4
34,   //else,4
34,     //resume();,4
34, },4
34, Not sure if this is it too...,2
34," &gt; In other words, they have the same versions of all common software?",3
34," Well, currently not, because I forgot that I updated home machine to debian/sid, but I recall that I was seeing this bug before I upgraded.",5
34, Mmmm... not 100% sure though. 90% ;),2
34, &gt; Do they use the same type of CPU?  ,3
34, &gt; I don't suppose it could be a 32bit / 64bit difference? ,3
34, Yep. ,6
34, Both use intel core duo,5
34, &gt; Not sure if this is it too... ,2
34," No, that is called when Ctrl+S or Ctrl+Q is pressed.",2
34, Can you try changing the interrupt key sequence to something else and see if it makes any difference.,5
34," For example, change the interrupt key to Ctrl+Y",5
34, stty intr /-\\Y,4
34," Then try strace, sleep, make etc. but use Ctrl+Y instead of Ctrl+C to kill them.",5
34, Chatting with ossi bringed up another very interesting usecase:,5
34, Fact: ctrl-c doesn't work in konsole,0
34, Next step: launch xterm and launch  strace -ttt -o konsole.trace konsole --nofork,5
34," Now in that started konsole app, 'make' breaks just ok!",5
34, Wonders :),6
34, strace fixes things :),1
34, After changing /-\\C to be /-\\Y situation is the same for /-\\Y as it was for /-\\C:,5
34," e.g. /-\\Y breaks 'strace', but not 'make'",5
34, &gt; strace fixes things :) ,4
34," You're doing two things there though, running Konsole with strace and also with the --nofork argument.  ",5
34," To be sure which was making a difference, you'd need to:",5
34," 1.  Run \""konsole --nofork\"" (without strace) and see if the problem is still there.",5
34," 2.  Start Konsole normally (with no arguments), then attach to it with strace (using strace -ttt -p &lt;pid of konsole&gt;) and see if the problem is still there.",5
34," The problem disappears for me with both 1 and 2, while changing the interrupt sequence has no effect just like Dmitry reported.",5
34," Any idea where to look in the code, where to set breakpoints, etc...?",3
34, Fixed by SVN commit #771570.,1

35, There seem to be some problems with the zoom out view.  ,0
35, It doesn't layout the activities properly.,0
35, Steps to reproduce:,0
35, 1. Zoom out.,0
35, 2. Add Activity.,0
35," Now only the newly added activity is shown, in the top left corner of the screen.",0
35, 3. Zoom in.,0
35, 4. Zoom out.,0
35," Now both the activities are shown, but not in the order they were added, and there is some whitespace around them.",0
35," If another activity is added, this happens again, and have to zoom in and out twice to get all 3 activities to show.",0
35," Same here at openSUSE, KDE 4.1 beta 2.",5
35," I'm using NVidia binary drivers btw, have an NVidia Geforce 6600 GT.",5
35," Just found out that the \""offset\"" of the activity overview changes when you double click on the second activity. ",0
35, The same probably happens too when adding an activity.,0
35," At this point, it's not possible anymore to use drag&drop to move to the first activity. ",0
35," Only zooming out, selecting the first, and zooming in fixes it.",1
35," yeah, that regression crept in a while ago, and it's been bugging me a lot.",2
35," we've actually got multiple bugs in this report, it'd be nice to separate them out (but I have to leave in a minute).",5
35," 1) adding/switching activity makes the view jump suddenly to another place (it's trying to make sure the activity is visible, and being stupid about it)",0
35, 2) dragging the view around to see other activities no longer works (regression! it worked before woc),0
35," Actually, dragging around the view does work here *except right after adding an activity*.  ",2
35, I just didn't know about that functionality when I filed this report.,2
35," Adding an activity makes the view jump to another place, and also the placement of the new activity seems arbitrary.",0
35, Bug = Add activity focuses view on the new activity until zoom level changes,0
35," well then, let's make the title a bit clearer",5
35, I think add activity option (and zoom out) should be removed in the 4.1 final.,2
35," This bug is quite big, plus there's no clear way to delete an activity. ",0
35," Also,performance when zoomed out is slow as hell.",0
35, I didn't report this issues because some of them are already reported and I thought others are pretty obvious.,2
35," Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea, but it's current status makes it confusing, useless and buggy :S",2
35, performace is fine for me. ,2
35, are you using nvidia?,3
35," there are already people making use of multiple activities, we're not going to take that away from them.",5
35," it'd be really really nice if this bug could be fixed somehow, though.",2
35, &gt; This bug is quite big,4
35," so huge it crashes your machine, loses dat, etc, right? ",3
35," this is a molehill, stop making it into a mountain.",5
35," &gt; but it's current status makes it confusing, useless and buggy",4
35, so don't use it. ,5
35, we have gotten many reports of people who DO like it and are using it for day to day work. ,5
35, i suppose your desire to see this set of problems hidden overrides their productivity?,2
35, and if we'd taken this approach in 4.0 we'd be even further behind.,2
