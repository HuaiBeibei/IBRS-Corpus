<Title>"(495584) Firefox - search suggestions passes wrong previous result to form history"</Title>

<From>'Justin Dolske'</From>
<Text>
<Sentence ID = "1.1"> MattN noticed a problem with the WIP patch from bug 469443 applied.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.2"> When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider (where entries for previous matching searches are).</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.3"> The problem here is that nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousResult to form history.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.4"> Instead of it being the previous form history search result, it's the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result (which contains the union of the form-history and search-suggest entries).</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.5"> So, when form history refines its results as you time, it can actually add *more* entries as data leaks from the suggestions result into form history result, and it thus looks like the divider is being drawn in the wrong place.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.6"> This bug wasn't visible before 469443, because nsFormFillController::StartSearch tries to QI the provided result to a nsIAutoCompleteSimpleResult. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.7"> The search-suggestion result is only implements nsIAutoCompletResult (no \"Simple\"), so the QI fails, historyResult nee previousResult becomes null, and thus Satchel was doing a new search every time.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.8"> EG:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.9"> 1) type \"b\" in the search field.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.10"> 2) form history finds 1 entry (\"blah\"), search-suggestions finds \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \"blah\" and \"baaa\".</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.11"> 3) type an \"l\" in the search field (\"bl\")</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.12"> 4) startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\"blah\", \"baaa\", \"bloop\", \"bzzz\"], Satchel filters this down to [\"blah\", \"bloop\"] to match the new \"bl\" search string</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.13"> 5) nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "2.2"> This fixes the problem, but isn't quite correct...</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.3"> If you type \"a&amp;lt;backspace&amp;gt;b\", satchel trying to use the results from the \"a\" search for the \"b\" search, and so nothing is found. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.4"> I suspect nsSearchSuggestions needs to throw away the old form history result when the search string changes like this, but I'm not entirely sure it's responsible for doing so, maybe satchel should be smarter about throwing away a previous result when the previous result's search string doesn't have a common prefix.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "3.2"> Ah. So, there's a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper (used to combine form history with search suggestions), and also a ._formHistoryResult in SuggestAutoComplete (the service itself, used to hold onto a form history result until a search suggestion is available).</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "3.3"> The simple fix it to just discard the service's form history result copy when startSearch() is called with a null previous result.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "3.4"> Otherwise it's trying to use a old form history result that no longer applies for the search string.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "1.1"> That pref was thought to be for extensions which wanted to completely replace our own Session Restore functionality.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "1.4"> Instead of adding try-catch-blocks wherever we use Session Restore, I'd much rather encourage extensions authors to override both nsSessionStartup and nsSessionStore to provide the same API with their own functionality (or implementing a dummy-API and making sure for themselves that they've correctly replaced all known consumers).</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.5"> This would also make the lives of those other extension authors simpler who so far can't be too sure that the Session Store component actually works (through whatever implementation).</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "11.1"> onemen: This patch significantly affects Tab Mix Plus:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "11.2"> Instead of disabling SessionStore, you'll now have to replace it by shipping a component which implements the same API.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "11.3"> You should be able to keep that component minimal, though, and just call your own code whenever the API is used.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "11.4"> This will make the lives of people using the SessionStore API (such as Session Manager) somewhat simpler, as they can just use the API without having to worry too much about the implementation behind it.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "11.5"> If you want to offer the option of switching between your and our implementation, see e.g. the ignore-history component of the Torbutton extension for how to overwrite a component with the original still being available internally (so that you can either pass API calls forward or handle them yourself).</Sentence>

<Title>"(491925) Firefox - Disable multitouch \"rotate\" gesture for cycling tabs"</Title>

<From>'Justin Dolske'</From>
<Text>
<Sentence ID = "1.1"> I've noticed that I frequently trigger the rotate gesture accidentally, usually while scrolling.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.2"> Gestures have improved since the original landing (when triggering the wrong gesture was really easy), but this articular gesture is still problematic.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.3"> The basic reasoning is that it's highly disruptive to be switched to another tab when you're not expecting it.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.4"> When it happens, you don't know what just happened until you notice that you're on some entirely different page, that's randomly to the left or right (1 or more tabs) from the page you thought you were on.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.5"> I'm don't think the rotate gesture for switching tabs is nearly as useful, discoverable, or a good fit as the other gestures are.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.6"> So, given this problem, we should just disable it for 3.5. </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "5.2"> usually I fix it right away but a quick browse though content-prefs.sqlite shows ~20 sites with zoom settings that I didn't know were set.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.3"> That's probably because zoom is a subtle effect (for 1 step, relative to the distraction that an accidental tab switch causes).</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.4"> While playing with different browser.gesture.twist settings, I've found twisting through tabs often resulted in triggering a zoom. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.5"> Probably because a twist is a very awkward gesture to make, especially if it's more than a quarter-turn... </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "5.6"> Around that point, my fingers want to spread or join, and that ends up read as a pinch. </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "7.1"> Fixed in HEAD &amp;gt;20090416.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.2"> In order to understand better what the ramifications might be of actually fixing this bug vs. better documenting the limitations and usage, I started by implementing a trial fix for the problem as reported.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.3"> It is pretty straightforward to rearrange the code to create the child resources (the file) even if the parent exists since the operation was created.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.4"> However, the problems occur later when you try to undo such an operation. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.5"> Since the operation \"remembered\" that the folder didn't exist when it was first created, the undo of the create file operation tries to also delete the folder.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.6"> This means that to truly fix the bug, we'd have to change the operations so that the resource descriptions were constantly updated to deal with changes that occurred.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.7"> So I still believe it's better to document more clearly what the intentions of the API are.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.8"> I've updated the javadoc for AbstractResourcesOperation, CreateFileOperation, and CreateFolderOperation.  </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "7.9"> In addition, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree already exist.  </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "1.1"> Inspired by Martin Oberhuber's mail about his \"lsc\" script for counting lines in a patch[1], I though that it maybe be worthwhile to embed such thing in the Apply Patch wizard itself. </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "1.3"> So, my proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a \"real contribution\".</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.4"> This is what first came to my head:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.5"> /-\\\\+? (\\s*\\S+\\s*)+$</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "17.1"> Martin, I see your point when you're saying that the \"common standard\" should be as good as possible, however I would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing. Here are the approaches so far:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.2"> 1) Use only given filters, by default no counting will be made. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.3"> This is how the patch from comment 4 worked. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.4"> Rejected.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.5"> 2) By default count lines using the simple patterns, which are currently used when parsing a patch (ie \"+\" and \"-\"), this can be modified in the pref page.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.6"> Patch in comment 13. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.7"> In HEAD.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.8"> 3) By default count lines using more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.9"> And again, this can be modified in the pref page. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.10"> If I understood you correctly this is what you meant in comment 15. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.11"> My main concern here is:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.12"> what if I would like to know total number of lines added in the patch (the filter idea looks to be an answer here but it's a pref value, it's not embedded in the parser itself, right?)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.13"> 4) By default count lines using both simple and sophisticated patterns at the same time. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "17.14"> The output would be something like this \"Patch contains X added and Y removed lines + Z added lines which are empty\". Again, the user could provide his own patterns... </Sentence>

<Turn>
<Date>'2009-01-09 00:28:00'</Date>
<From>'Brian Vosburgh'</From>
<Text>
<Sentence ID = "1.1"> Here is the JavaDoc for IAdapterManager.computeClassOrder(Class):</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.2"> Returns the class search order for a given class. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.3"> The search order from a class with the definition class X extends Y implements A, B is as follows:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.4"> - the target's class: X </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.5"> - X's superclasses in order to Object </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.6"> - a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces (in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces) </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.7"> This comment is not perfectly clear. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.8"> In particular, it does not complete the example by explicitly listing the exact order the example classes and interfaces are returned.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.9"> I came up with a slightly richer example:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.10">     interface A extends M, N</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.11">     interface B extends O</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.12">     class Y implements C, D</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.13">     class X extends Y implements A, B</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.14"> [The declarations for interfaces C, D, M, N, and O are trivial.] </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.15"> The order of classes and interfaces returned by AdapterManager.computeClassOrder(X) is:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.16">     class X</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.17">     interface A</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.18">     interface B</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "1.22">     class Y</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.23">     interface C</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.24">     interface D</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.25">     class java.lang.Object</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.26"> This conflicts with the JavaDoc. The class X is the first thing returned, but it is *not* followed by \"X's superclasses in order to Object\". </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.27"> It is followed by a breadth-first list of X's interface hierarchy\", *then* followed by X's superclass Y, which is then followed by a breadth-first list of Y's interface hierarchy; and so on, up to  java.lang.Object.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.28"> Also, the JavaDoc has what reads to me as a contradiction:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.29">     a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.30"> vs. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.31">     in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.32"> What actually happens *does* feel like a \"breadth-first\" search; </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.33"> but that would not be accurately described as \"A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\". </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.34"> But maybe I'm reading it wrong....</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.35"> It might be worth discussing which is the \"preferred\" behavior: the behavior described by the JavaDoc or the behavior implemented in AdapterManager. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "1.36"> In some ways having all the classes first, followed by the interfaces might make more sense than the current implementation.... </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "2.1"> You are right on both counts. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.2"> The implementation doesn't match the spec, and there is a contradiction in the spec itself. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.3"> Now the question is what do we do about it.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.4">  - For the contradiction, I think we should stick with the breadth-first search, and delete the parenthetic comment about the example (\"A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\")</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.5">  - For the spec not matching the behaviour, my instinct is to \"fix\" the spec to match the implementation, to avoid the risk of breaking clients. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.6"> This would be a very subtle change that could affect clients in unpredictable ways. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.7"> On the other hand if there are really compelling reasons to change the implementation to match the spec, I'd be curious to hear them.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.8"> I did some research and found that the implementation did match the spec until Febuary 20, 2004, when I change the implementation. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.9"> At that time the spec wasn't part of the API. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "2.10"> The spec was later added to the API (IAdapterManager#computeClassOrder) without checking that the implementation still matched. </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "3.1"> It would be interesting to know what triggered the change in behavior.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "3.2"> I guess the question is whether superclasses take precedence over interfaces defined lower in the hierarchy, i.e. does the implementation take precedence over the specification? </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "3.3"> I can see arguments for either way; but I guess I would probably come down on the side of giving specification precedence. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "3.4"> So, I guess you argue further that all the interfaces could precede all the classes?</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "4.1"> It looks like this change was made inadvertently during a large batch of changes to add support for the adapters extension point (bug 32498). </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "4.2"> I think since this change was introduced accidentally, and this is a clear violation of a long-standing specification, I'm leaning towards fixing the implementation. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "4.3"> I noticed the spec also doesn't mention the interfaces of the target class' superclasses. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "4.4"> I think the corrected spec should read:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "4.5">          * &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "9.1"> The patch gets the gist of what I want, but it looks ugly in places. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.2"> Here's what I think on how to solve those:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.3"> My idea was that the error handlers should be implemented with simple ftp_connection_send() commands, that set errors automatically. </Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.4"> So the is_directory handler would look something like this:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.5"> static void</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.6"> error_550_is_directory (FtpConnection *conn, const FtpFile *file)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.7"> {</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.8">   guint response = ftp_connection_send (conn,  RESPONSE_PASS_500, \"cwd %s\", file);</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.9">   if (response == 550)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.10">     {</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.11">       g_set_error (&amp;conn-&amp;gt;error, G_IO_ERROR,  G_IO_ERROR_IS_DIRECTORY, _(\"File is a directory\"));</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.12">     }</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.13">   else if (STATUS_GROUP (response) == 5)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.14">     {</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.15">       ftp_connection_set_error_from_response (conn, response);</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.16">     }</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.17"> }</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.18"> So we'd have a bunch of error handlers named error_550_$ERROR_WE_CHECK() like error_550_not_found or  error_550_permission_denied that do some ftp sending magic to figure out specific things.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.19"> While writing the above code, it occured to me that we might want to have a new flag \"RESPONSE_PASS_550\" just for the 550 error code, which would help in quite some cases and make the above function look like this:</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.20"> static void</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.21"> error_550_check_directory (FtpConnection *conn, const FtpFile *file)</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.22"> {</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "9.27">     }</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.28"> }</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.29"> I also think that we want a seperate ftp_connection_send_and_check function, that does the job of doing special 550 checks, as there's a lot of cases where those aren't needed. </Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "2.4"> (Or, I assume, if it is surrounding something that has an obvious label to read instead, like a button, and if the child control takes focus).</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "3.1"> The problem occurs when safeRefresh() is called from calDavCalendar.js.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "3.9"> So, we'll enter into an infinite loop because getUpdatedItems() calls right at the beginning checkDavResourceType() since the calendar was marked as disabled.</Sentence>

<Sentence ID = "9.3"> And I don't think that that is actually happening.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.4"> Because you are moving from the filebrowser, SqlCollectionLocation doesn't notice that it's dealing with a file already in the collection, and therefore doesn't use the special code that stops it from removing files from the source collection.</Sentence>
<Sentence ID = "9.5"> I am a bit surprised that the patch even works (does it?). </Sentence>
